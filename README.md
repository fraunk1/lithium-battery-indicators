# Lithium Battery Leading Indicators

**Commercial Aviation Risk Assessment — Executive Dashboard & Intelligence Report**

An intelligence product identifying leading indicators for lithium battery events on commercial aircraft. Monitors consumer trends (demand surges, price collapses, energy density creep, miniaturization, import volumes), maps each product category to specific air transport regulations, and provides an overall threat posture assessment.

## What's Inside

### Executive Dashboard
- Overall threat posture (ORANGE — Elevated)
- Top 3 leading indicators with trend direction
- Emerging products watch list (6 items, color-coded)
- 14-product risk matrix with 5 indicator categories
- Price collapse tracker (7 categories with quality floor analysis)
- Compliance gaming visualization (the "99 Wh pattern")
- Seasonal risk calendar, regulatory timeline, priority actions
- 12-source citation panel with clickable hyperlinks

### Full Report
- **Section 1**: Regulatory baseline (49 CFR 173.185, 14 CFR 382, IATA DGR 67th Ed.)
- **Section 2**: Incident landscape (648 total incidents, ~2/week, +388% since 2015)
- **Section 3**: Leading indicator framework (5 categories × alert thresholds)
- **Section 4**: Product risk registry (14 products with battery specs, regulatory mapping, incident history)
- **Section 5**: Watch list (7 emerging products with escalation triggers)
- **Section 6**: Signal analysis (Amazon BSR, social media, price intelligence, FCC filings)
- **Section 7**: Cargo/shipper intelligence (e-commerce risk, SoC compliance)
- **Section 8**: Seasonal outlook (risk calendar + product launch overlay)
- **Section 9**: Recommended actions by stakeholder
- **Appendices**: Battery chemistry reference, Wh calculations, data sources, glossary

## Key Findings

- **648 incidents** reported to FAA (2006–2025), trending at ~2 per week
- **Vapes are #1 threat** — 35% of all incidents, driven by disposable market expansion
- **38% of passengers** put lithium devices in checked bags despite prohibitions
- **6 of 7 tracked product categories** sell below the cost-of-quality floor
- **Sodium-ion batteries** represent a regulatory gap — not classified under lithium rules
- **99 Wh compliance gaming** — products deliberately engineered to 99.16 Wh (26,800 mAh × 3.7V)
